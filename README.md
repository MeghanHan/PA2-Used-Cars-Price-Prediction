To improve inventory of used car dealerships for the business to be more profitable, we built regression models to explore the relationship between used car features and price following the CRISP-DM framework. The findings are listed below:
- Used car prices are positively correlated with the number of cylinders, the size of the car and negatively correlated with the age and the mileage of the car.
- The better the condition of the car, the higher the price.
- Used cars of common colors (e.g. white, silver, grey, black) can sell for a higher price than less common colors (e.g. orange, purple, yellow). Black and white cars have the best resale value.
- Front-wheel-drive cars are less valuable than back-wheel-drive cars and four-wheel-drive cars.

Based on the findings, we have the following recommendations:
- Increase the inventory of full-size cars in good condition.
- Increase the share of cars that are made fairly recently without a lot of mileage.
- Get cars with more cylinders for higher price.
- Pick common colors such as white, silver, grey and black and avoid unusual colors such as orange, purple and yellow.
- Reduce the number of front-wheel drive cars in the inventory.
