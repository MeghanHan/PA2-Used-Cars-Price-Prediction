## Findings:
- Used car prices are positively correlated with the number of cylinders, the size of the car and negatively correlated with the age and the mileage of the car. 
- The better the conditon of the car, the higher the price.
- Used cars of common colors (e.g. white, silver, grey, black) can sell for a higher price than less common colors (e.g. orange, purple, yellow). Black and white cars have the best resale value.
- Front-wheel-drive cars are less valuable than back-wheel-drive cars and four-wheel-drive cars.
